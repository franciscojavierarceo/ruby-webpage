<p>Hello! My name is Francisco Javier Arceo. 
  
<br> <br>
I am the Founder and CEO of <a href="http://unidosfin.com">Unidos</a>, a technology company bringing financial wellness to the Latino community. I'm also the Executive Director of Data Science at <a href="https://www.Understood.org">Understood.org</a> where we are dedicated to shaping a world where millions of people who learn and think differently can thrive at home, at school, and at work. 
I was previously at Goldman Sachs where I worked in the Credit Risk team developing and executing the underwriting strategy for their Digital Retail Bank (<a href="https://www.Marcus.com">Marcus, by Goldman Sachs</a>).
Prior to that I worked at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia where I helped launch <a href="https://www.tymebank.co.za/">TymeDigital</a>, South Africa's first digital bank. And prior to that I was at AIG working in their <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/how-aig-moved-toward-evidence-based-decision-making">Science</a> team.
<br> <br>
I'm passionate about data science, technology, engineering, digital products, and philanthropy. 
  
Feel free to checkout some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo?tab=repositories">GitHub</a> where you'll find some work I've done on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Web Development, Cloud Computing, and other random things.
