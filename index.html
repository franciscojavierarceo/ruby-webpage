<p>Hello! My name is Francisco Javier Arceo, I'm a Data Scientist for the Decision Science Group at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). 

<br> <br>
I am also a graduate student at <a href="http://datascience.columbia.edu">Columbia University in the City of New York</a> studying Data Science where I've mostly focused my coursework on various forms of Machine Learning.

<br> <br>
My specialties and interests are in statistics, econometrics, and machine learning. <a href="https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo?tab=repositories">Here's a link</a> to to some of my projects on GitHub where you'll find some work I've done on Bayesian Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other random things.
