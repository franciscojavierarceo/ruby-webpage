<p>Hello! My name is Francisco Javier Arceo. 
  
<br> <br>
I'm an Executive Director at Understood.org where I am working with a team of great people launching the Workplace Initiative. 
I was previously at Goldman Sachs in their Digital Finance department where I worked in the Credit Risk team developing and executing our strategy for Digital Retail Bank.
And prior to that I worked at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia where I helped launch TymeDigital, South Africa's first digital bank. 
<br> <br>
I'm passionate about data science, technology, engineering, digital products, and philanthropy. 
  
Feel free to checkout some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo?tab=repositories">GitHub</a> where you'll find some work I've done on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Web Development, Cloud Computing, and other random things.
