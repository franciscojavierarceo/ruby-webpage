<p>I was born of immigrant parents from Mexico. I, myself, am a natural-born citizen of the United States. I am an elementary school graduate of the Chicago Public School system and a high school graduate of Marian Catholic High School. </p>

<p>I am a 27 year old Chicagoan, born on the South-East side of the city. I'm a White Sox baseball fan. I love statistical theory, mathematics, and machine learning. I spend much of my time reading, writing, playing guitar, singing songs, watching the occasional movie, exercising, and spending time with my family.</p>
