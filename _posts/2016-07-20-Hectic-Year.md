It's been a hectic year thusfar, I spent most of my time either at work, on the train, in class, at the gym, or with my lovely girlfirend Stephany (probably the best part of my year). 

During this chaotic year I got the opportunity to improve my computer science (CS) chops (e.g., building my website), learn a ton more of ([Bayesian](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/EECS6892) [Machine Learning](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/COMS4721), and dive into [Deep Learning](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/ECBME6040). At the gym I was able to also increase my deadlift from a pathetic 185 to 405 (still not great)! And increase my bench from 155 to 215!! So to say the least it's been a pretty awesome year, for both nerdy and non-nerdy reasons.

This summer I decided to take a Mathematical Analysis course using the classic Rudin textbook and boy has that been an experience. It's been my first pure mathematics course in nearly 9 years, so to say that it's been a challenge is an understatement but I *love* the material. It's absolutely fascinating to me, regardless of how much work I have to put in to actually understand it. 

Also, let me just say, Stephany is amazing. During those late nights of studying and homework, she was sweet enough to feed me, keep me company, and keep me sane. I am so grateful to have such a caring, beautiful, and loving woman in my life. :) 

Professionally, my work/career has also been going well, I love my job and my team is really incredible. My boss is the best, he's been encouraging me to learn a ton of new stuff and I feel more and more like a real computer scientist (but I have a long way to go before I actually call myself that). The learning curve has also been steep, but I feel like I'm making progress, which is really rewarding. I love computers and I love CS, so I really want to explore it more...maybe I'll pursue a third masters in CS or EECS (Electrical Engineering and CS) and finally get into hardware.

That might be something I explore in the future. I love school, learning about new things, and getting a degree out of the whole thing, so maybe I will pursue a third masters, I guess we'll see what 2017 holds.

Anyways, thanks for reading! I just wanted to take a second to review how simultaneously exhausting and wonderful this year has been. Going to school and working a full-time job is a handful, but I guess old habits die hard.
