To say that I am the luckiest man alive is a severe understatement; it feels like a mediocre and inadequate attempt at succinctly explaining the enumerable gifts in my life. Frankly, it feels lame...but it's the truth. 

Saturday was the greatest day of my life. My beloved partner in crime, Stephany, said "Yes" to my proposal.

Stephany is the life force that keeps me together. She was there for me when [I lost my best friend Ervi](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mentor-who-shaped-me-what-i-learned-from-child-whose-life-arceo?trk=prof-post); she has taken care of me when I've been sick; she's patiently waited for me to finish homework before being able to spend quality time with her; and she's loved me for who I am---a nerdy, goofy, large and bumbling idiot.

I've been planning this proposal since June (~3 months), but I've wanted to marry Steph for far longer than that; I knew about 3 months after we met that I wanted to marry her---I waited 22. She's the most incredible woman I've ever known, so I wanted it to be perfect and I think it went pretty well. :)

So here's the story.

## Step 0: Deception

The hardest part of all of this was keeping it from Steph. Fortunately, her sister, Susan, was willing to help me keep this all a secret and plan the whole thing! The second hardest part was balancing this while taking my Analysis class this summer, but, hey, who needs sleep anyways. The third most difficult thing was lying to Steph about where I was certain nights and what I was doing. It was hard mostly because I am a terrible liar (which I think is a good thing), so I doubled up on my lies (sometimes tripled up) when she figured out I was trying to deceive her, luckily, that worked out okay.

## Step 1: The Proposal

With a bit of effort, Susan was persuasive enough to get Steph to the Brooklyn Promenade and there Susan and I created a trail of roses that led to me and my guitar standing in a heart of roses (you may barf now).

## Step 2: A Little Show

When Steph and I first started dating, I promised to write her a song, so last Christmas I gave her a poem on a plaque with a photograph of us at my cousin's wedding in Chicago. I wrote the poem knowing I would turn it into a song but she had no idea. So, when I proposed I played her the song I wrote her last December for the first time (in front of a crowd that I did not expect to be there /insert heavy sweating and anxiety/). 

I was so nervous that I was shaking while playing! But I began to calm as I looked at her and then the crowd seemed to fade into the distance, then she made me the happiest man in the world.

</p>

I heard that one little word and I was overwhelmed with joy, so much so that I immediately lifted her in excitement...and in my typical baffoonish fashion I forgot to put the ring on her. No worries though, I put the ring on after I realized it.

## Step 3: Surprise Family Dinner

After a quick photoshoot with our photographer, I surprised her with a dinner with both of our famillies, which was a very enjoyable meal. Also, further data supporting my scatter-brained nature, I forgot to tell my parents the address of the venue so they showed up slightly late (it was still a nice surprise for Steph though).

## Step 4: Surprise Celebration!

The final piece was a celebration at a bar with our friends and family. After dinner our parents ran off to the bar where the surprise party was being held and our friends came from California, Chicago, and DC just to see us. It was an absolute blast.

It was certainly a lot of work to get this all together and it was quite exhausting, but it was the most amazing day with my beloved fianc√©. :) 

Thank you all who came and shared this day with us and who helped me set up everything. As I said, I am the luckiest man alive.
