I *love* school.

Learning is my passion...and while I certainly can learn outside of the classroom, I find myself starry-eyed while on an academic campus.

This semester was my last semester as a master's student in the Data Science department at Columbia, which is extremely bitter sweet. It's nice to complete my second graduate degree, but I will miss studying and learning new material in that wonderful environment.

Either way this past semester has been incredible. I got the chance to spend it doing some real research with a current Ph.D. student, [Chris Kedzie](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kedzie/).


# So, what'd we build? 

We developed an algorithm to summarize events over time. One use case is for real-time disaster summarization. The figure below shows what the core algorithm is really doing and how it learns.

Pretty neat huh? 

Below is a look at how the model is learning to select or skip sentences based on the neural network.

For more technical details you're welcome to look at the [Github Repo](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/DQN-Event-Summarization) and the working paper.

To me, the cool components are that we are using (1) Recurrent Neural Networks (i.e., deep learning), (2) Natural Language Processing, and (3) Reinforcement Learning. These are three things I've been really interested in learning so it was a great experience diving more deeply into them outside of homework assignments. It was also a really cool experience to learn [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Torch](http://torch.ch/). 

I got to present our work earlier this week to the [NLP Group at Columbia](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi) and it was really fun getting to talk to such talented researchers. 

Hopefully Chris and I will be able to polish this work up and submit it for publication in 2017!

To all of my dear friends and family that I didn't communicate with as often as I usually do, I am sorry!! I spent all of my time coding, here's a graph below to prove it!

The good news is that I've returned from my hiding and am so looking forward to seeing all of the wonderful people in my life again...and to spend some quality time with my lovely fiancée.

Lastly and most importantly, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of you! I can't wait to see all of you again soon.
